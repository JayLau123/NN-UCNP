From inputs to outputs: access steady state population distribution at given transition rates

Can we build a surrogate model, with hundreds transition rates, or more specifically and essentially, with decades physical constants as inputs, then get the accurate population distribution among 13 energy levels($\mathrm{Tm}^{3+}$) and 41 energy levels($\mathrm{Er}^{3+}$), multiplying the desired transition rates, that finally accounts for the emission intensity?
